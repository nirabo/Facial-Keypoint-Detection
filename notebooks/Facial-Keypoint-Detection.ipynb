And typically the most useful kind of edge-detection is one that preserves only the important, global structures (ignoring local structures that aren't very discriminative).  So removing local structures / retaining global structures is a crucial pre-processing step to performing edge detection in an image, and blurring can do just that.  \n",

Because our input data are images, we can employ a *convolutional neural network* to recognize patterns in our images and learn how to identify these keypoint given sets of labeled data.\n",

The training dataset contains several thousand $96 \\times 96$ grayscale images of cropped human faces, along with each face's 15 corresponding facial keypoints that have been placed by hand, and recorded in $(x, y)$ coordinates.
